Guagua Change Logs

Changes for Guagua-0.4.2
    * Add internal(embeded) ZooKeeper support.
    * Add default total iteration number if user don't set '-c'.
    * Improve readme and other guagua docs.
Changes for Guagua-0.4.1
    * Improve guagua shell to follow hadoop command.
    * Add kmeans example in guagua-mapreduce-examples.
    * Improve API java docs.
Changes for Guagua-0.4.0
    * Consistent guagua package in guagua-client. For this package, we have a shell 'guagua' help user select the 
      platform, user only needs to set the jar, the master and worker classes and other guagua or mapred parameters by 
      using '-D<key=value>'.
    * Support jobs run in Parallel in GuaguaMapReduceClient, only mapreduce adapter support it, yarn adapter doesn't 
      support it.
Changes for Guagua-0.3.0
    * Delete unneeded ZooKeeper znodes ASAP, for example: in iteration 4, delete all znodes from iteration 1 and 2, node
      remove znodes for iteration 3 because of fail-over needed.
    * Improve Hadoop mapper progress to make sure users can get accurate progress in web and console.
    * Improve nerual network implementation.
    * Fulfill guagua client input validation.
    * Add slow task detection mechanism, if one task iteration execution time is over a threshold value, task will kill 
      itself to trigger fail-over task on other machines.
Changes for Guagua-0.2.0
    * Make guagua mapreduce work on Hadoop 0.20.2, 1.2.0 and 2.2.0, test guagua mapreduce on apache, cloudera, 
      hortonworks hadoop distributions.
    * Change default task gc to concurrent gc to decrease gc stopping time to avoid ZooKeeper session timeout.
    * Build two packages for guagua-mapreduce to make guagua work on hadoop 1.0 and hadoop yarn.
    * Make guagua yarn works, token setting in GuaguaAppMaster.
    * Fix the bug: OOM for zookeeper and OOD(disk) for zookeeper.
    * Any exception guagua will send kill task signal to Job Tracker to make sure issue task can be killed.
    * Add detailed info to mapper status for user to check.
Changes for Guagua-0.1.0
    * Master-Workers services implementation for whole guagua arch.
    * Sync and async ZooKeeper coordinators for both master and workers.
    * MapReduce adapter implementation by using only mapper tasks.
    * Yarn adapter implementation with fail-over like mapreduce tasks. By default each task has 4 attempts.
    * Guagua-core fail-over support to make restarted-task starts at last successful iteration.
    * Basic IO for master result and worker results and adapter for hadoop writable.
    * Add examples: sum values and distributed neural network implementation.
    * Make all interceptors and properties set by hadoop like commnad: '-D<key=value>'.
    * Input splits like Pig: set combination size, guagua can combine each worker according to the size.
    * Profile intercepter liker memory profilers and worker timers.
